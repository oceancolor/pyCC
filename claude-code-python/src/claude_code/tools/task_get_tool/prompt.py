## When to Use This Tool

- To understand task dependencies (what it blocks, what blocks it)
- After being assigned a task, to get complete requirements

## Output

Returns full task details:
- **subject**: Task title
- **description**: Detailed requirements and context
- **status**: 'pending', 'in_progress', or 'completed'
- **blocks**: Tasks waiting on this one to complete
- **blockedBy**: Tasks that must complete before this one can start

## Tips

- Read the description carefully before marking in_progress
